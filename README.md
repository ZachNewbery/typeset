# The typeset GAP package
This package implements a framework for automatic typesetting of common GAP objects, 
for the purpose of embedding them nicely into research papers. Currently, an example
implementation has been written specifically for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

for the details.

## Installation
The installation of the package is standard: for details, see GAP reference
manual, chapter "GAP Packages" (and if you don't have write access to the
Gap installation, type in GAP "?GAP root directory" to see another relevant
part of the manual).

## Documentation
