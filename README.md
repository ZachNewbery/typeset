# The typeset GAP package
This package implements a framework for automatic typesetting of common GAP objects, 
for the purpose of embedding them nicely into research papers. Currently, an example
implementation has been written specifically for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

The typeset package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version. See the FSF's own site <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
for the details.

## Installation
The installation of the package is standard: for details, see GAP reference
manual, chapter [GAP Packages](https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap76_mj.html) 
(and if you don't have write access to the Gap installation, type "?GAP root directory"
within GAP to see another relevant part of the manual).

## Documentation
Full information and documentation can be found in the manual, available
as a [PDF](doc/manual.pdf) or as HTML on the package homepage at
